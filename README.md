# Student-Performance-Dataset
The data is student final grade in secondary education of two schools.Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (m) and Portuguese language (p).
I have classified these students into three categories, "good", "fair", and "poor", according to their final exam performance. Then I analyzed a few features that have significant influence on students' final performance, including, Alcohol Consumption, Parents Education Level, Frequency Of Going Out. 
Finally, I have created various machine learning models to predict students' final performance classification and have compared models performance based on one-out sample accuracy score.
